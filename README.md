# About Me

####  My name is Ethan Brockway, I am a fresh graduate of Kansas Universities' software development bootcamp. Over the course of 6 months I learned a lot of information about code as well as completed 22 different projects with different front-end and back-end languages. I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS along with Javascript, Express.js, React, SQL, mongoDB, and GraphQL(One of my favorites). I was taught how to work with groups to create fullstack applications, organize code to be readable, yet optomized to work effiecently, and of course how to manage my time with projects. 

####  I love working with backend files such as creating typeDefs and mutations for graphQL, working with express routes, and even working on some front end routing with React. I am currently working on a React website called "[Inventory Manager]"(https://github.com/EthanBrockway/Inventory-Manager)" that allows users to search for shows and save/share them for their peers to see and comment on.
